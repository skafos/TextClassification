**DEPRECATION WARNING**

This example app was intended for use by the legacy Skafos platform and is no longer being maintained. On 05/29/2019, a new version of [Skafos](https://skafos.ai) was released, streamlining model delivery to the edge.

TextClassification is an example app that uses the Skafos platform for CoreML model integration and delivery. It's a good starting point for diving in, or a good reference for integrating Skafos in to your own app. Skafos is a platform that streamlines CoreML model updates without needing to submit a new version to the app store everytime a new model is ready for use.

This TextClassification example app specifically integrates and deploys a Text Classification machine learning model. [Text Classification](https://docs.metismachine.io/docs/text-classification) is a machine learning technique that enables you to assign tags or categories to arbitary text, based on its content. The example model that is provided in this app trains a sentiment classifier model on Yelp reviews. This sentiment classifier model predicts whether or not the text in question is a positive or negative review. For more details about how to use and customize this model, please navigate to the [Skafos Turi Text Classifier repo on github](https://github.com/skafos/TuriTextClassifier).

## Getting Started

Before diving in to this example application, make sure you have setup an account at [Skafos](https://skafos.ai) and run through the [quickstart](https://dashboard.skafos.ai/quickstart/project)

## Project Setup

1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. In the project directory, run `pod install`
3. Open the project workspace (`.xcworkspace`)
4. In your project's settings under `General` change the following:
    * Display Name
    * Bundle Identifier
    * Team
    * Any other settings specific to your app.

## Skafos Framework Setup

1. Make sure the following capabilites are enabled:
    * Background modes: `Background fetch` and `Remote notifications`
    * Push notifications
2. Inside `AppDelegate.swift` make sure to use your Skafos **publishable key** in: `Skafos.initialize`

## Now What?

Now take a moment to click on `TextClassifier.mlmodel` and under *Model Class* section click the arrow next 
to `TextClassifier` and have a peek at the class that Xcode generates from the CoreML Model. Now, inside of 
`MainViewController.swift` (around line 95) take a look at the `reloadModel` function to see an example of
how to load a model using the *Skafos* framework. While in `MainViewController.swift` also look (around line 86)
for how to setup `NSNotificationCenter` to listen for Skafos notifications that the model has been updated.
